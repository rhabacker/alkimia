<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label
each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files will vary
from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<title>Adding or Editing Quote Sources</title>

<para>
  Adding or editing quote sources is not recommended for anyone but the most
  technical user.  You should feel comfortable reading HTML and writing complex
  regular expressions.  If this doesn't sound like you, we recommend writing to the
  developer's list if none of the quote sources work for you. Ideally, please point
  us to a web page where these quotes can be obtained.  Additionally you can consult
  with members of the KDE Community Forum for &onlinequoteseditor; as they may already
  have a solution available for your needs.
</para>

<para>
  If you do feel up to the challenge, here's how it works.  The quote sources are
  contained in the <guilabel>Online Quotes</guilabel> dock widget. You can choose an
  existing source to edit, or create a new one.  When you are done with your changes,
  be sure to press the <guibutton>Accept</guibutton> button in the <guilabel>Quote
  details</guilabel> dock widget. Your changes are not saved by default.
</para>

<para>
  The first thing to consider in an online quote source is the URL.  This is the page
  that is fetched from the web.  You will see a %1 in all sources, and a %2 in
  currency sources.  For investments, %1 is replaced by the trading symbol.  For
  currencies, %1 is replaced by the From currency, and %2 is replaced by the To
  currency.  This URL is then fetched, all HTML tags are (optionally) removed, and
  that stripped file is then sent to the page parser.
</para>

<para>
  Note that the URL can also be a file: URL, which the quote fetcher takes to be the
  path to an executable script.  It will pass any command-line arguments to it that
  you have specified, and feed the stdout to the page parser.  For example, you might
  have a script called getquote.sh that contains custom quote logic, taking the
  symbol as a single parameter.  Your URL would be
  <quote>file:/path/to/getquote.sh %1</quote>.
</para>

<para>
  The page parser looks for a symbol, a date, and a price.  Regular expressions tell
  it how to extract those items from the page.  Please review the documentation for
  the <ulink url="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qregularexpression.html">QRegularExpression
  class</ulink> for the exact syntax regular expressions used by &onlinequoteseditor;. There
  should be exactly one capture expression, surrounded by parentheses, in each regexp
  field.  The date format further tells the date parser the order of year, month, and
  day.  This date format should always be in the form "%x %x %x". where x is y, m, or
  d.  The date parser is very smart.  <quote>%m %d %y</quote> will
  parse <quote>December 31st, 2005</quote> as easily as <quote>12/31/05</quote>.  Two
  digit years are interpreted as being in the range of 1950-2049.
